        * Added "ciseaux" directory to the project. Retrieving the files
          from the command line in ciseaux. Added -b or --blocksize option
          to fix a different blocksize than the 32768 default one.

        * Tests done with GFileMonitor and inotify. They suffers from
          limits : 1024 directories/files is the limit for GFileMonitor
          and 8192 is the limit for inotify (on my system). It seems that
          the only way to do this is to get the notifications directly
          from the kernel : redirfs or pluginfs ?

# client

* integrates fanotify in a cleaner way and try to see wether a directory
  creation can be detected.
* Review entire design to fit into "small memory" systems.


# ideas

* use some cryptography to cypher exchanges (gpg ?)
* add a fourth program to clean older datas and metas datas (nettoie ?)
* add to serveur a specific url to send more than one buffer of data
  associated to their hashs. This may speed up data transfert.

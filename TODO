monitor
=======

* Add monitors to all subdirectories of a directory (see
  g_file_enumerate_children)
* Retreive meta informations about a file : size, owner, group, creation
  date, rights
* Need a cache for the monitored directory to avoid a whole disk traversal
  each time we restart the process

monitor
=======

* Need something different from GFileMonitor because we hit _SC_OPEN_MAX
  limit too quickly.
* Retreive meta informations about a file : size, owner, group, creation
  date, rights
* Need a cache for the monitored directory to avoid a whole disk traversal
  each time we restart the process

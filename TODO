monitor
=======

* Need something different from GFileMonitor because we hit _SC_OPEN_MAX
  limit too quickly. inotify suffer the same problem. Some project that
  may be of interest :
    - http://www.redirfs.org/tiki-index.php
    - http://www.pluginfs.org/

* Retreive meta informations about a file : size, owner, group, creation
  date, rights

* Need a cache for the monitored directory to avoid a whole disk traversal
  each time we restart the process

# ideas that may be done (or not)

## Not in the roadmap

* use some cryptography to cipher exchanges (gpg ? - JOSE ?)
* UI integration to desktop managers like Xfce, Gnome, MATE, QT ?
* file_backend: compress blocks on disk + ciphering ?
* server: add a backend for Ceph.
* server: add a /Stats.json URL to give some statistics about the
          server.
* server: convert error answers to valid json messages.
* server: add an url that will ask to the server if a file is correcly
          and entirely stored and restorable.
* client: fit into "small memory" systems.
* client: free main_struct_t's memory at the end of the program.
* check if an already existing block is really identical to the one
  already stored.
* add a fourth program to clean older data and meta data ?



## In the roadmap already.

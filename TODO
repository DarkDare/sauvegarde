# ideas that may be done (or not)

## Not in the roadmap

* use some cryptography to cipher exchanges (gpg ? - JOSE ?)
* UI integration to desktop managers like Xfce, Gnome, MATE, QT ?
* file_backend: compress blocks on disk + ciphering ?
* serveur: add a backend for Ceph.
* serveur: add a /Stats.json URL to give some statistics about the
           server.
* client: fit into "small memory" systems.
* client: free main_struct_t's memory at the end of the program.


## In the roadmap already.

* add a fourth program to clean older data and meta data (nettoie ?)
* Filters to exclude files by path or by extension
* client: adaptative block size that will depend on the file size. Option
          to choose adaptative or fixed.

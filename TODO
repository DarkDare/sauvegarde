# ideas that may be done (or not)

## Not in the roadmap

* use some cryptography to cipher exchanges (gpg ? - JOSE ?)
* UI integration to desktop managers like Xfce, Gnome, MATE, QT ?
* file_backend: compress blocks on disk + ciphering ?
* serveur: add a backend for Ceph.
* client: adaptative block size that will depend on the file size. Option
          to choose adaptative or fixed.
* client: fit into "small memory" systems.
* serveur: file_backend needs a path prefix to know where to save files.
           Add an option in configuration file to indicate this prefix.

## In the roadmap already.

* add a fourth program to clean older data and meta data (nettoie ?)
* add to serveur a specific url to send more than one buffer of data
  associated to their hashs. This may speed up data transfert.
* Filters to exclude files by path or by extension
* client: integrates fanotify in a cleaner way and try to see wether a
        directory creation can be detected.

Learnt things
-------------

* GFileMonitor in Glib 2.26 does not warn when the file descriptors are
  exhausted. The default limit on my system is 1024 files monitored
* inotify interface does warn when one can not add a new watch. It says
  that the disk is full ! The limit on my system is 8192 watchs at a time.
* We should use another mechanism to monitor a whole filesystem as limits
  for GFileMonitor and inotify techniques are very low compared to the
  number of directories a filesystem might have (my /home have 37826
  directories !). We might want to look at redirfs
  (http://www.redirfs.org/tiki-index.php) or pluginfs
  (http://www.pluginfs.org/).
